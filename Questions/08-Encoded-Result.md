# Encoded Result

> Jack's exam result is out. He wants to send his marks to his friend Grace but he don’t want his parents to know his marks. So, he creates a string, S, in which he has encoded the marks in between some random characters. Find the product of digits in the string to see his final marks.

#### Input format:
T – number of test cases <br>
S – Encoded String

#### Output Format:
Marks - Product of numbers

#### Constraints:
1 <= T, Marks <= 10<sup>18</sup> <br>
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

#### Sample Input:
3 <br>
h3ll0 <br>
B1G <br>
s1mu1t3neously

#### Sample Output:
0 <br>
1 <br>
3

#### Explanation: 
h3ll0 –> 3 * 0 = 0 <br>
B1G – >1 = 1 <br>
s1mu1t3neously –> 1 * 1 * 3 = 3
