# Chandu's Gangsters

> In 2019, Chandu's terror was spreading as his men take out rival gang members by the dozen. Chandu wanted to rule 7 nearby areas and selected a group of 7 members for the same. He also gave them "code" for communication. Chandu used to communicate with his members every weekend to get an update. Seeing their progress, one afternoon he prepared lunch for them; seven chairs, seven plates, seven forks and seven knives for seven hungry gangsters. Surprisingly on that day, nine gangsters came, instead of seven, each of them claiming to be one of Chandu's seven accomplices. Luckily, each had a "code" (which Chandu had given them). This "code" is a positive integer less than 100. Being a mathematician, Chandu realised long ago that the sum of numbers on the "code" of his seven accomplices was exactly 100. You are manager of Chandu and he has shared this information with you. Now, you have to decide which of the seven gangsters are legit. Write a program which determines which gangsters are legit, i.e. pick seven of nine numbers that add to hundred.

#### Input Format:
Contains the 9 numbers separated by the space denoting the code of each Ganster.

#### Output Format:
You have to print the seven numbers(codes) in the same line separated by the space denoting the "codes" of Chandu's seven gangsters.

#### Sample Input:
1 15 35 90 10 5 9 25 98

#### Sample Output:
1 15 35 10 5 9 25

#### Explanation: 
Out of the given 9 value, only these 7 values sum up to form 100.
