> Professor Harold from FMR University needs two students for some research work. He is also a very good motivator. After thinking a lot, he decided to select one student from Section A of BCA having the highest attendance. And another student from Section B having lowest marks. In this way students will be motivated to achieve higher attendance and the student with lowest percentile will be motivated to learn something new.

#### Input format:
First line consist an integer N1 i.e number of students in Section A. <br>
Second line consist an integer N2 i.e. number of students in Section B. <br>
Third line consist of N1 numbers denoting the attendance of each student of Section A. <br>
Forth line consist of N2 numbers denoting the marks of each student of Section B. <br>

#### Output Format:
First line – Highest Attendance from Section A <br>
Second line – Lowest Marks from Section B

#### Constraints:
1 <= N1,N2 <=1000
1<= Attendance, Marks <= 100
